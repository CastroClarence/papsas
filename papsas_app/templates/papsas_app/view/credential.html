        <div class="bio">
            <p>I graduated college in 1998 from the University of St. La Salle. I was an active member of the Campus Ministry during my entire college years. After graduation, I migrated to California and worked in various companies such as The Beverly Hills Hotel, Washington Mutual, Pentacor Aerospace, Child Care Resource Center & California State University, Northridge. My family moved back to the Philippines in 2006 and I returned to work in 2009.</p>
            <p>I began as Placement Coordinator in UB. I also completed my Masterâ€™s degree in the same institution. In the course of 12 years, I have been promoted to Alumni & Placement Officer for both campuses and have been given an additional post as Director of Student Affairs & External Programs. Having worked for different industries, I must say that working in Academe is the one I find most fulfilling. To see former students succeed in their respective careers is truly the most rewarding.</p>
