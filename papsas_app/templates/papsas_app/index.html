                            The Region 5 Chapter of the Philippine Association of Practitioners of Student Affairs and Services, Inc. (PAPSAS) launched the Bicol Young Leaders Summit (BYLS) as its flagship student development program. <br><br>
                            The 1st PAPSAS BYLS was hosted by the Ateneo de Naga University, Naga City, on January 20 – 21, 2023. More than 200 student leaders, student affairs and services (SAS) administrators and staff, and advisers of student councils and organizations from Bicol Region participated in this event. <br><br>
                            The summit featured three resource speakers, namely: Ralph Jacinto Quiblat, director of the Ateneo de Manila University Office of Student Activities; Magno Edilberto Conag III, founder and CEO of Nueca Technologies, Inc.; and Ben Secretario, president of the Ten Outstanding Boy Scouts of the Philippines Association. Consistent with the BYLS’s whole-person formation framework, the said speakers discussed the four-session topics: Self Awareness, Servant Leadership, Project Development, and Collaboration and Network Building. <br><br>
                            Naga City Mayor Nelson Legacion and ADNU University President Fr. Roberto Exequiel Rivera, S.J. graced the occasion and delivered their keynote speeches. <br><br>
                            Aside from attending the plenary talks and conversations, the participants took part in The Amazing Race-inspired game, where groups had to complete tasks in eight stations. After the teambuilding challenges, the same groups each performed in the talent show dubbed as “BYLS Got Talent.” <br><br>
                            Group representatives also presented their project ideas after undergoing a project development workshop using the Business Model Canvas template.<br><br>
                            A synthesis given by the master of ceremony Allysa Salvino, and a commitment-building pledge led by BYLS 2023 project head and ADNU student leader-debater Jerwin Roy Villacruz capped off the two-day event. <br><br>
                            The 1st BYLS was organized by a team of students, with the supervision of PAPSAS Region 5 Chapter headed by its Regional President Rodolfo ‘Sonny’ Virtus Jr.  <br></p>
